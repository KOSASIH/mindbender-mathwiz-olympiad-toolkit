# Solutions and Explanations

Welcome to the Solutions and Explanations section! This document contains solutions and explanations for the practice problems provided in the Practice Problems section.

## Problem 1: Number Theory

**Solution:** The smallest positive integer divisible by each of the numbers 1 through 10 is the least common multiple (LCM) of those numbers. The prime factorization of each number is:

- 1: Not necessary
- 2: 2
- 3: 3
- 4: 2^2
- 5: 5
- 6: 2 * 3
- 7: 7
- 8: 2^3
- 9: 3^2
- 10: 2 * 5

Taking the highest power of each prime factor, the LCM is: LCM(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 = 2520.

## Problem 2: Combinatorics

**Solution:** The word "MATHEMATICS" has 11 letters, with the letter 'M' repeated 2 times, the letter 'A' repeated 2 times, the letter 'T' repeated 2 times, and all other letters occurring only once. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 11! / (2! * 2! * 2!) = 11*10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3 / (2*2*2) = 4989600.

## Problem 3: Geometry

**Solution:** In triangle ABC, using the law of cosines, we have: AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 * AB * BC * cos(A). Substituting the given values, we get: AC^2 = 10^2 + 8^2 - 2 * 10 * 8 * cos(60°) = 100 + 64 - 160 * 0.5 = 100 + 64 - 80 = 84. Therefore, AC = √84 = 2√21 units.

## Problem 4: Algebra

**Solution:** To solve the quadratic equation 2x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0, we can factor it as (2x - 1)(x - 2) = 0. Setting each factor equal to zero gives us two solutions: 2x - 1 = 0 or x - 2 = 0. Solving these equations yields x = 1/2 or x = 2.

## Problem 5: Graph Theory

**Solution:** In a graph with 6 vertices and 8 edges, the number of connected components can be determined by examining the graph's connectivity. Each connected component is a subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. Counting the number of connected components in the graph yields the answer.

## Problem 6: Probability

**Solution:** There are 13 hearts and 13 diamonds in a standard deck of cards. Since there is 1 card that is both a heart and a diamond (the ace of diamonds), the total number of heart or diamond cards is 13 + 13 - 1 = 25. Therefore, the probability of drawing a heart or a diamond is 25/52 = 25/52.

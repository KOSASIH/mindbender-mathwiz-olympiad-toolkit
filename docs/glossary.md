# Glossary

Welcome to the Glossary section! This document contains definitions and explanations of key mathematical terms and concepts frequently encountered in AI Mathematical Olympiads.

## 1. Prime Number

**Definition:** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is a number that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

## 2. Factorial

**Definition:** The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

## 3. Polygon

**Definition:** A polygon is a two-dimensional geometric shape consisting of a finite number of straight line segments connected to form a closed loop. Polygons are classified based on the number of sides they have, with common examples including triangles (3 sides), quadrilaterals (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), and so on.

## 4. Congruence

**Definition:** Two geometric figures are said to be congruent if they have the same shape and size. In other words, one figure can be transformed into the other through a combination of translations, rotations, and reflections without changing its size or shape.

## 5. Permutation

**Definition:** A permutation of a set of objects is an arrangement of those objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of n distinct objects is given by n factorial (n!).

## 6. Probability

**Definition:** Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. It is typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the event is impossible and 1 indicates that the event is certain to occur.

## Conclusion

This glossary provides definitions and explanations of key mathematical terms and concepts commonly encountered in AI Mathematical Olympiads. By familiarizing yourself with these terms and concepts, you'll be better equipped to understand and solve mathematical problems with confidence and precision.
